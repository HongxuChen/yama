1. The basic command to generate LLVM IR for our analysis is:
   clang -emit-llvm -c <input file> -o <output file>

2. To generate human readable LLVM IR file, we can use either:
   clang -emit-llvm -S <input file> -o <output file>

   or first generate .bc file and then use llvm-dis to generate .ll file

3. NOTE that the above commands will generate LLVM IR files which
   make heavy use of load and store instructions. In order to perform the
   symbolic range analysis, we need LLVM IR that mostly use registers,
   instead of load and store instructions. To this end, we need to use
   opt -mem2reg to transform the .bc file before starting the analysis.

4. As suggested by Hongxu, we should be careful with the exact version of
   LLVM that we are using. Since the current version on SWAG server is 3.6.2,
   we will refer to the documentations at: http://llvm.org/releases/3.6.2/docs/index.html
